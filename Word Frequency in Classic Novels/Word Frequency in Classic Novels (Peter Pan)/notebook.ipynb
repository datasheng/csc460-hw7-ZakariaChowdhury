Did you know that although the play was titled \"Peter Pan, Or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\", J. M. Barrie's novel was actually titled \"Peter and Wendy\"? </p>\n<p>You're going to explore and analyze Peter Pan's text to answer the question in the instruction pane below.

Finally, remember that you are only tested on your answer, not on the methods you use to arrive at the answer!</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you haven't completed a DataCamp project before you should check out the <a href=\"https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/33\">Intro to Projects</a> first to learn about the interface. <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-importing-data-in-python\">Intermediate Importing Data in Python</a> and <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-natural-language-processing-in-python\">Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python</a> teach the skills required to complete this project.
